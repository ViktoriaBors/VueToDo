# Dummy To Do list
## Practice project for Vue learninig

### **_Introduction_**
After finishing The Net Ninja - Vue Beginner Tutorial, I was not fully ready to jump to my own big side-project. I needed to practice more, mainly the composition API and fetching data part. To Do app is on every beginner's list, so it was time to make one in Vue. 

### **_Used Technologies_**
1. Vue 3 Js
2. Bootstrap 5
3. Json Placeholder

**Aim of the Project**
It is a practice mini project to get more hands-on experience with Vue.

**Challenges within the Project**

 I am 100% certain I am going to have challenges with the CRUD methods. We will see. 

 **Day 2 with CRUD app**
 
 Already facing with some problems. I can see in the console that the CRUD operations are working, but it doesnt update or re-render on the site... I think I need to use lifecycle hooks, but not sure which one and how to connect it to a click event (if it is even possible).

 I also tried to make this application in option Api (Vue 2 style) - but I got stucked, so I jumped back and continued with the composition Api. My plan is to still try the "older" version too later.

## **_What have I learned_**
Vue and more Vue

## Deployed: soon
